		<p>Called to the Devil and the Devil did come. Said to the Devil, "Devil, do you like drums? Do you like cigarettes, dominos, rum?" Said, "Only sundown, sundays, christmas." Some days end when I need a few friends. Now and again, I could never hope to keep them. Thought to give friends what I thought that they wanted, never had they needed a good friend as I've been.</p>
		<p>Don't get me venting on friends who resent you, 'cause all you've ever done is been a noose to hang on to. They thought was a necklace, and reckless, they fell into hell, where you both hang with nothing to do but-</p>

		<p>Called to the Devil and the Devil said, "Hey, why you been calling this late? It's like 2am, and the bars all close at 10 in hell, that's the rule I made. Anyway, you say you're too busy saving everybody else to save yourself, and you don't want no help. Oh well. That's a story to tell."</p>
		<p>Like, you could let it all go. You could let it all go, it's called: freefall. It's called: freefall. You could let it all go, you could let it all go. 'Cause ain't shit free but falling out, and that shit's easy, let me show you how, it's like-</p>
