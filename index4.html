		<p>Sweetheart, you look a little tired, when did you last eat? Come in and make yourself right at home, stay as long as you need. Tell me, is something wrong? If something's wrong, you can count on me. You know I'll take my heart clean apart if it helps yours beat.</p>
		<p>It's okay if you can't find the words. Let me take your coat and this weight off of your shoulders.</p>
		<p>Like a force to be reckoned with; a mighty ocean or a gentle kiss. I will love you with everything I have. Like a tidal wave, I'll make a mess. Or calm waters, if that serves you best. I will love you without any strings attatched.</p>
		<p>It's okay if you can't catch your breath, you can take the oxygen straight out of my chest. I know exactly how the rule goes, put my mask on first â€” no, I don't want to talk about myself, tell me where it hurts. I just want to build you up, build you up 'till you're good as new. (And maybe, one day, I'll get around to fixing myself too.)</p>
		<p>I don't even know where to start, already tired of trying to recall when it all fell apart. I just want to love you, to love you, <i>to love you well.</i> I just want to learn how, somehow, to be loved myself.</p>
		<p>Like a force to be reckoned with; a mighty ocean or a gentle kiss. I will love you without any strings attatched. And what a priviledge it is to love, a great honour to hold you up.</p>
		<p>Like a force to be reckoned with; a mighty ocean or a gentle kiss. I will love you with every single thing I have. Like a tidal wave, I'll make a mess. Or calm waters, if that serves you best. I will love you without any strings attatched.</p>
		<p><i>I love you without a single string attatched.</i></p>
